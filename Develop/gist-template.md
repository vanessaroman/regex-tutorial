# Matching URL Regex Tutorial

Welcome to my Regex tutorial! In this tutorial you will learn how to use a Regular Expression to find/match URLs within code.

Just fyi, Regular Expressions are a series of characters that define a search pattern.

## Summary

The Regex we will learn about is the following:

    ^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/

This Regex will help us search for specific strings in code that match the specifications of a URL.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors help Regular Expressions match a certain position before, after, or en between characters. The character ^ helps match with a string that begins with whatever character follows it. The character $ helps match strings that end with whatever character that is in front of it.
